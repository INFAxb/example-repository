## Community Guidelines
- Usually, you should not work on the main branch. Instead work on your own feature branch.
- Merging branches to the main branch must be verified by at least 2 other *trusted contributers*.
- Commit messages must have reasonable meaning, and must contain both why and what you did in a short sentence (grammar is irrelevant, make it understandable).

\*A trusted contributor is a person, like an owner, or other higher members of the organisation.
